Managing your computers resources
Your OS manages resources on your computer such as the CPU, RAM, File Storage, I/O Devices and network connections.
The OS is essentially a manger of those resources and allocates them to different programs and users when necessary to preform a particular task.
It almost acts like an interface between the user and the computer.
