Managing your computers resources

Your OS manages resources on your computer such as the CPU, RAM, File Storage, I/O Devices and network connections.
The OS is essentially a manger of those resources and allocates them to different programs and users when necessary to preform a particular task.
A big component of that is memory management. This could be in the form of de-allocating memory when a process has been stopped or is no longer needed or when multiprogramming deciding which process will get more memory and the amount of memory



Processor Management

Through a function called process scheduling your OS determines which process gets the processor and for how much time. The OS keeps track of the processor and status of processes through a program known as traffic controller. The OS allocates your CPU to a process and de-allocates the CPU when a process is no longer needed.

Device Management

Then OS keeps track of all your devices througna program known as the i/o controller and manages device communication via their drivers. The OS will decide which processes get a device and for how much time. It will allocate devices in the most effecient way possible and de-allocate them when they are no longer needed.
